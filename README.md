## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddeshbarhate311998/Autocomplete-Component.git
   cd Autocomplete-Component
2. Install the dependencies
   npm install
Running the App
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

Project Overview
This project implements an autocomplete feature for a music library. Users can search for songs, and the app provides suggestions based on the input. The suggestions include the song titles, and users can click on the suggestions to autofill the input.

Component Details
App.js
The main component of the application. It contains:

State Management: Uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state.
Data Fetching: Fetches song data from a local data.json file.
Autocomplete Logic: Filters suggestions based on user input.
UI Components: Renders a navigation bar, an input field, and a list of suggestions.
Key Features
Dynamic Suggestion List: Filters and displays song suggestions as the user types.
Highlight Matching Text: Highlights the part of the song title that matches the user input.
Keyboard Navigation: Allows users to select a suggestion using the Enter key.
How to Run the Component
Ensure the data file data.json is available in the public directory.
Start the application using npm start.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Use the input field to search for songs and see the autocomplete suggestions in action.
